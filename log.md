# 100 Days Of Code - Brian's Log

### Day 0: Monday 13th February, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Getting started. Cloning the [100 days of code repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and tweaking it to the style, layout and flow that I want.

**Thoughts:** Slightly worried I entirely forgot how to push an existing project to a new repo. But a quick google and 10 minutes of holding my head in my hands in shame, all up and running.
